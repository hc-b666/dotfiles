# 🧪 bobur's Dotfiles

This is my Arch Hyprland dev setup — because life’s too short for bloated distros.

---

## 📦 What's in the box?

- `hypr/` - [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) configs for swooshy windows and I love the gaps between programs and border colors (hyprlock does not work when u automatically close your pc xD)
- `waybar/` - I hate this bar actually - shows active windows, wifi for some reason, battery status and time (had not time and desire to update this yet)
- `wofi/` - app launcher - yanked from somewhere 
- `kitty/` - Terminal configs with **nerd fonts** and **transparency that does nothing but looks cool**
- `alacritty/` - Another terminal. I just love the name **Alacritty**.
- `nvim/` - setup by primeagen.
- `.bashrc` - currently using bashrc, will try zshell too
- `.tmux.conf` - tmux catppuccin theme for bottom bar 
- `.vimrc` - sometimes i use this too
- `wallpapers/` - Anime girls? Dystopian cityscapes? Who knows, it’s a vibe. (yep, gpt generated)

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Arch Linux (btw)
- Hyprland
- Wayland stuff (wlroots gang 🧪)
- Nerd Fonts
- `tmux`, `neovim`, `bash`, `kitty`, `alacritty`, `wofi`, etc.
- A strong will to fix your rice every update

## 🚀 Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hc-b666/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
# Link the files how you like using stow or chezmoi
```

## 🎯 Goals
- Be more productive than the default GNOME setup
- Look cooler than 99% of Windows users
- Just saw those arch ricers' setup and wanted to try my own. so far so good
